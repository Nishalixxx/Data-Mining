# Data-Mining
This project uses data mining techniques to explore, summarise, and visualise multiple datasets, using both statistical and computational methods. The tasks will look through data cleaning, analysis, binning, visualisation, and feature transformation.

### Objectives
* **Explore Data:** Load, identify categorical and numerical features, compute frequencies, and create data visualisations to understand feature relationships.
* **Summarize and Group Data:** Calculate univariate and multivariate summaries, group data by categorical variables, and interpret the statistical insights.
* **Perform Data Transformation:** Execute principal component analysis and discuss its effectiveness in distinguishing classes.
* **Implement Data Cleaning and Binning:** Clean datasets by handling missing values and apply binning techniques to simplify data interpretation.
* **Create Data Cubes and Aggregate Results:** Leverage data cube structures for multidimensional data analysis.
